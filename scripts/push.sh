#!/usr/bin/env bash
# push.sh — ships the work: the commits and this version's tag.
#
# Usage:
#   ./push.sh              push the commits and the tag; CI builds and publishes the Release
#   ./push.sh --full       ALSO build the binaries here and upload them (-f works too)
#
# What CLOSES a version is ./commit.sh (bump, changelog, tag). This script only ships it.
#
# By default nothing is built here. Pushing the tag starts .github/workflows/release.yml, which
# cross-compiles and publishes — and on a public repository that costs nothing, so there is no
# reason to spend a workstation's time on it or to make the artefact depend on whichever Go
# version that machine has.
#
# `--full` is the escape hatch: it builds locally and uploads, for when the workflow cannot run
# (GitHub Actions down, or a release that has to go out from here). The tag still triggers the
# workflow, which will overwrite the assets with its own build — same inputs, same output.
#
# Requires: `gh` authenticated with write access to the repo (only with --full)
#   gh auth login
